# Creating an EdgeX OS Image

## Introduction
This guide walks you through creating an Ubuntu Core OS image that is preloaded with an EdgeX stack. We use [Ubuntu Core](https://ubuntu.com/core/docs) as the Linux distribution because it is optimized for IoT and is secure by design. We configure the image and bundle the current snapped versions of EdgeX components. After the deployment the snaps will continue to receive updates for the latest security and bug fixes (depending on the selected channel).

This guide is divided into three chapters to create:

- Ubuntu Core + EdgeX, with default configurations
- Ubuntu Core + EdgeX, with service configuration overrides
- Ubuntu Core + EdgeX, with custom service and device configuration files

Each chapter results in a working Ubuntu Core OS image that can be flashed on a disk and booted with the expected EdgeX stack.

In this example, we will create an `amd64` image, but the instructions can be adapted to other architectures and even for a Raspberry Pi. We will use the Device Virtual service to simulate devices and produce synthetic events.

!!! note
    This guide has been tested on an `amd64` **Ubuntu 22.04** as the desktop OS. It may work on other Linux distributions and Ubuntu versions.

    Some commands are executed on the desktop computer, but some others on the target Ubuntu Core system. For clarity, we use **ðŸ–¥ Desktop** and **ðŸš€ Ubuntu Core** titles for code blocks to distinguish where those commands are being executed.

    An Intel NUC11TNH with 8GB RAM and 250GB NAND flash storage has been used as the target `amd64` hardware. 

We assume the following tools are installed on the desktop machine:

- [snapcraft](https://snapcraft.io/snapcraft) to manage keys in the store and build snaps
- [YQ](https://snapcraft.io/yq) to validate YAML files and convert them to JSON
- [ubuntu-image](https://snapcraft.io/ubuntu-image) to build the Ubuntu Core image

Install them using the following commands:
```bash title="ðŸ–¥ Desktop"
sudo snap install snapcraft --classic
sudo snap install yq
sudo snap install ubuntu-image --classic
```

Before we start, it is a good idea to read through the following documents:

- [Inside Ubuntu Core](https://ubuntu.com/core/docs/uc20/inside) to get familiar with the Ubuntu core internals
- [Getting Started using Snaps](../../getting-started/Ch-GettingStartedSnapUsers) to understand general EdgeX snap concepts

## A. Create an image with EdgeX components

In this chapter, we will create an OS image that includes the expected EdgeX components.

### Configure the Ubuntu Core partitions
The configuration of the partitions is defined in the [Gadget snap](https://snapcraft.io/docs/gadget-snap).

The [`pc` gadget](https://snapcraft.io/pc) is available as a prebuilt snap in the store, however, we need to build our own to extend the size of disk partitions to have sufficient capacity for our EdgeX snaps.

We will use the source code for Core20 AMD64 gadget from [here](https://github.com/snapcore/pc-amd64-gadget/tree/20) as basis.

!!! tip
    For a Raspberry Pi, you need to use the [pi-gadget](https://github.com/snapcore/pi-gadget) instead.

Clone the branch and enter the directory:
```bash title="ðŸ–¥ Desktop"
git clone https://github.com/snapcore/pc-amd64-gadget.git --branch=20
cd pc-amd64-gadget
```

In `gadget.yml`: under `volumes.pc.structure`, find the item with name `ubuntu-seed` and increase its size to `1500M`. This is to make sure our seeded snaps fit in the partition.

Then, build the gadget snap:
```bash title="ðŸ–¥ Desktop"
$ snapcraft
...
Snapped pc_20-0.4_amd64.snap
```

!!! note
    You need to rebuild the snap every time you change the `gadget.yaml` file.

### Create an Ubuntu Core model assertion
The [model assertion](https://ubuntu.com/core/docs/reference/assertions/model) is a digitally signed document that describes the content of the OS image.

Refer to [this article](https://ubuntu.com/core/docs/custom-images#heading--signing) for details on how to sign the model assertion. Here are the needed steps:

1) Create a developer account

Follow the instructions [here](https://snapcraft.io/docs/creating-your-developer-account) to create a developer account, if you don't already have one.

2) Create and register a key

```bash title="ðŸ–¥ Desktop"
snap login
snap keys
# continue if you have no existing keys
# you'll be asked to set a passphrase which is needed before signing
snap create-key edgex-demo
snapcraft register-key edgex-demo
```
We now have a registered key named `edgex-demo` which we'll use later.

3) Create the model assertion

First, make yourself familiar with the Ubuntu Core [model assertion](https://ubuntu.com/core/docs/reference/assertions/model).

Find your developer ID using the Snapcraft CLI:
```bash title="ðŸ–¥ Desktop"
$ snapcraft whoami
...
developer-id: SZ4OfFv8DVM9om64iYrgojDLgbzI0eiL
```
or from the [Snapcraft Dashboard](https://dashboard.snapcraft.io/dev/account/).

!!! info
    Unlike the official documentation which uses JSON, we use YAML serialization for the model. This is for consistency with all the other serialization formats in this tutorial. Moreover, it allows us to comment out some parts for testing or add comments to describe the details inline.

Create `model.yaml` with the following content, replacing `authority-id`, `brand-id`, and `timestamp`:
```yaml
type: model
series: '16'

# authority-id and brand-id must be set to your developer-id
authority-id: SZ4OfFv8DVM9om64iYrgojDLgbzI0eiL
brand-id: SZ4OfFv8DVM9om64iYrgojDLgbzI0eiL

model: ubuntu-core-20-amd64
architecture: amd64

# timestamp should be within your signature's validity period
timestamp: '2022-06-21T10:45:00+00:00'
base: core20

grade: dangerous

snaps:
- # This is our custom, dev gadget snap
  # It has no channel and id, because it isn't in the store.
  # We're going to build it locally and pass it to the image builder. 
  name: pc
  type: gadget

- name: edgex-device-virtual
  type: app
  default-channel: latest/stable
  id: AmKuVTOfsN0uEKsyJG34M8CaMfnIqxc0
```

4) Sign the model assertion

We sign the model using the `edgex-demo` key created and registered earlier. 

The `snap sign` command takes JSON as input and produces YAML as output! We use the YQ app to convert our model assertion to JSON before passing it in for signing.

```bash title="ðŸ–¥ Desktop"
# sign
yq eval model.yaml -o=json | snap sign -k edgex-demo > model.signed.yaml

# check the signed model
cat model.signed.yaml
```

!!! note
    You need to repeat the signing every time you change the input model, because the signature is calculated based on the model.

### Build the Ubuntu Core image
We use ubuntu-image and set the following:

- Path to signed model assertion YAML file
- Path to gadget snap that we built in the previous steps

This will download all the needed snaps and build a file called `pc.img`.
Note that even the kernel and OS base (core20) are snap packages!

> **Note**  
> If you plan to use an emulator to install and run Ubuntu Core from the resulting image, it is a good idea to allocate additional writable storage. This necessary if you want to install additional snaps interactively or upgrade existing ones on the emulator.
>
> The default size of the `ubuntu-data` partition is `1G` as defined in the gadget snap. When installing on actual hardware, this partition extends automatically to take the whole remaining space on the disk volume. However, when using QEMU, the partition will have the exact same size because the image size is calculated based on the defined partition structure. The 1GB `ubuntu-data` partition will be 90% full after first boot. You can configure the image to be larger so that the installer expands the partition automatically as with a large disk volume. 
>
> To extend the image size, use the `--image-size` flag in the following command. For example, to add 500MB extra (the original image is around 3.5GB), set `--image-size=4G`.

```bash title="ðŸ–¥ Desktop"
$ ubuntu-image snap model.signed.yaml --validation=enforce --snap pc-amd64-gadget/pc_20-0.4_amd64.snap 
Fetching snapd
Fetching pc-kernel

WARNING: "pc" installed from local snaps disconnected from a store cannot be refreshed subsequently!
Copying "pc-amd64-gadget/pc_20-0.4_amd64.snap" (pc)

# check the image file
$ file pc.img
pc.img: DOS/MBR boot sector, extended partition table (last)
```

The warning is because we side-loaded the gadget for demonstration purposes. In production settings, a custom gadget would need to be uploaded to the [IoT App Store](https://ubuntu.com/internet-of-things/appstore) to also receive updates.

!!! note
    You need to repeat the build every time you change and sign the **model** or rebuild the **gadget**.

!!! done
    The image file is now ready to be flashed on a medium to create a bootable drive with the needed applications!

### Boot into the OS
You can now flash the image on your disk and boot to start the installation.
However, during development it is best to boot in an emulator to quickly detect and diagnose possible issues.

Instead of flashing and installing the OS on actual hardware, we will continue this guide using an emulator. Every other step will be similar to when image is flashed and installed on actual hardware.

Refer to the following to:

- [Run in an emulator](#run-in-an-emulator) - used in this guide
- [Flash the image on disk](#flash-the-image-on-disk)

### TRY IT OUT
In this step, we connect to the machine that has the image installed over SSH, validate the installation, and do some manual configurations.

We SSH to the emulator from the previous step:
```bash title="ðŸ–¥ Desktop"
ssh <user>@localhost -p 8022
```
If you used the default approach (using `console-conf`) and entered your Ubuntu account email address at the end of the installation, then `<user>` is your Ubuntu account ID. If you don't know your ID, look it up using a browser from [here](https://login.ubuntu.com/) or programmatically from `https://login.ubuntu.com/api/v2/keys/<email>`.

List the installed snaps:
``` title="ðŸš€ Ubuntu Core"
$ snap list

```

Let's install the [EdgeX CLI](https://snapcraft.io/edgex-cli) to query information from EdgeX core components  to easily query various APIs:
``` title="ðŸš€ Ubuntu Core"
$ snap install edgex-cli
edgex-cli 2.2.0 from Canonicalâœ“ installed
$ edgex-cli --help
EdgeX-CLI

Usage:
  edgex-cli [command]

Use "edgex-cli [command] --help" for more information about a command.

$ edgex-cli ping
core-metadata: Thu Aug 11 10:27:47 UTC 2022
core-data: Thu Aug 11 10:27:47 UTC 2022
core-command: Thu Aug 11 10:27:47 UTC 2022
```

We can verify that the core services are alive.

Let's now query the devices:
``` title="ðŸš€ Ubuntu Core"
$ edgex-cli device list
No devices available
```

There are no devices, because the installed EdgeX Device Virtual is disabled and not started by default.

``` title="ðŸš€ Ubuntu Core"
$ snap start edgex-device-virtual 
Started.
$ snap logs -f edgex-device-virtual 
2022-08-11T10:34:19Z edgex-device-virtual.device-virtual[5483]: level=INFO ts=2022-08-11T10:34:19.238771398Z app=device-virtual source=devices.go:87 msg="Device Random-UnsignedInteger-Device not found in Metadata, adding it ..."
...
2022-08-11T10:34:19Z edgex-device-virtual.device-virtual[5483]: level=INFO ts=2022-08-11T10:34:19.247960347Z app=device-virtual source=message.go:58 msg="Service started in: 417.152451ms"
```

This shows that the virtual devices have been added to Core Metadata and the service has started. Rerun the same CLI command:

``` title="ðŸš€ Ubuntu Core"
$ edgex-cli device list
Name                           Description                ServiceName     ProfileName                    Labels                    AutoEvents

```

From the service logs, we can't see if the service is actually producing data. We can increase the logging verbosity by modifying the service log level:

``` title="ðŸš€ Ubuntu Core"
$ snap set edgex-device-virtual config.writable-loglevel=DEBUG
$ snap restart edgex-device-virtual 
Restarted.
$ snap logs -f edgex-device-virtual 
...

```

The data is being published to the message bus and Core Data will be storing it. We can query to find out:

``` title="ðŸš€ Ubuntu Core"
$ edgex-cli reading list --limit=2
Origin               Device                         ProfileName                    Value                 ValueType
11 Aug 22 10:50 UTC  Random-UnsignedInteger-Device  Random-UnsignedInteger-Device  14610331353796717782  Uint64
11 Aug 22 10:50 UTC  Random-UnsignedInteger-Device  Random-UnsignedInteger-Device  62286                 Uint16
```

We now have a running EdgeX platform with dummy devices, producing synthetic readings. We can access this data on the localhost, but not from another host. This is because the local service ports only listen on the loopback interface. Access from outside is only allowed via the API Gateway and after authentication. 

It is possible to configure the services to listen to other or all interfaces and access them from outside. Note that this will expose the endpoint without any access control!

To make Core Data's server listen to all interfaces (at your own risk):
``` title="ðŸš€ Ubuntu Core"
$ snap set edgexfoundry app-options=true
$ snap set edgexfoundry apps.core-data.config.service-serverbindaddr="0.0.0.0"
$ snap restart edgexfoundry.core-data
Restarted
```

!!! tip
    Drop the `apps.core-data.` prefix to make this a global configuration setting for all EdgeX services inside that snap!


Let's exit the SSH session:
``` title="ðŸš€ Ubuntu Core"
$ exit
logout
Connection to localhost closed.
```

... and query data from outside
```bash title="ðŸ–¥ Desktop"
curl --silent --show-err http://localhost:59880/api/v2/reading/all?limit=2 | jq
```

```json title="Response"
{
  "apiVersion": "v2",
  "statusCode": 200,
  "totalCount": 7040,
  "readings": [
    {
      "id": "5907adb3-18f6-4cf9-9826-216285b7f519",
      "origin": 1660225195484643300,
      "deviceName": "Random-Integer-Device",
      "resourceName": "Int32",
      "profileName": "Random-Integer-Device",
      "valueType": "Int32",
      "value": "445276022"
    },
    {
      "id": "86c87583-a220-44d9-b29a-e412efa97cc3",
      "origin": 1660225195423943200,
      "deviceName": "Random-Integer-Device",
      "resourceName": "Int64",
      "profileName": "Random-Integer-Device",
      "valueType": "Int64",
      "value": "-6696458089943342374"
    }
  ]
}
```

However, as expected, we can't access securely via the API Gateway:
```bash title="ðŸ–¥ Desktop"
curl --insecure https://localhost:8443/core-data/api/v2/reading/all?limit=2
```

```json title="Response"
{"message":"Unauthorized"}
```

You can follow the instructions from the [getting started](../../getting-started/Ch-GettingStartedSnapUsers/#adding-api-gateway-users) to create a key pair, add a user to API Gateway, and generate a JWT token to access the API securely.

In this chapter, we demonstrated how to build an image that is pre-loaded with some EdgeX snaps. We then connected into a (virtual) machine instantiated with the image, verified the setup and performed additional steps to interactively start and configure the services.

In the next chapter, we walk you through creating an image that comes pre-loaded with this configuration, so it boots into a working EdgeX environment that even includes your EdgeX public key and user.

## B. Override basic configurations
    
In this chapter, we will improve our OS image so that:

- We don't need to manually start EdgeX Device Virtual
- We have our EdgeX public key inside the image and can securely access the service endpoints via API Gateway

### Create key pair and JWT token
Create a private/public key pair:
``` title="ðŸ–¥ Desktop"
$ openssl ecparam -genkey -name prime256v1 -noout -out private.pem
$ openssl ec -in private.pem -pubout -out public.pem
read EC key
writing EC key
```

Print the public key:
``` title="ðŸ–¥ Desktop"
$ cat public.pem 
-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
MFkwEwYHKoZIzj0CAQYIKoZIzj0DAQcDQgAE5slZTyp5Zfxoos7TljHgPSbGm3As
NZGr6EEet300xbC4VUVGcQBSEsSZmGMTxaCMlzvKt1dwUNxBFDAemWXSyg==
-----END PUBLIC KEY-----
```
In the next section, we will add this as the public key of the admin user.

Create a script called `create-jwt.sh` with the following content:
```bash
#!/bin/bash -e

# this is hardcoded because we'll be adding an admin user with this ID to the image
USER_ID=1

header='{
    "alg": "ES256",
    "typ": "JWT"
}'

TTL=$((EPOCHSECONDS+86400)) # valid for 1 day

payload='{
    "iss":"'$USER_ID'",
    "iat":'$EPOCHSECONDS',
    "nbf":'$EPOCHSECONDS',
    "exp":'$TTL'
}'

echo "Payload: $payload"

JWT_HEADER=`echo -n $header | openssl base64 -e -A | sed s/\+/-/ | sed -E s/=+$//`
JWT_PAYLOAD=`echo -n $payload | openssl base64 -e -A | sed s/\+/-/ | sed -E s/=+$//`
JWT_SIGNATURE=`echo -n "$JWT_HEADER.$JWT_PAYLOAD" | openssl dgst -sha256 -binary -sign private.pem  | openssl asn1parse -inform DER  -offset 2 | grep -o "[0-9A-F]\+$" | tr -d '\n' | xxd -r -p | base64 -w0 | tr -d '=' | tr '+/' '-_'`

TOKEN=$JWT_HEADER.$JWT_PAYLOAD.$JWT_SIGNATURE

echo $TOKEN > admin-jwt.txt
echo "Token written to admin-jwt.txt:"
echo "$TOKEN"
```

The script will read the `private.pem` file from the same directory.

Make the script executable and run it to get a JWT (JSON Web Token):
``` title="ðŸ–¥ Desktop"
$ chmod +x create-jwt.sh
$ ./create-jwt.sh 
Payload: {
    "iss":"1",
    "iat":1660314677,
    "nbf":1660314677,
    "exp":1660401077
}
Token written to admin-jwt.txt:
eyAiYWxnIjogIkVTMjU2IiwgInR5cCI6ICJKV1QiIH0.eyAiaXNzIjoiMSIsICJpYXQiOjE2NjAzMTQ2NzcsICJuYmYiOjE2NjAzMTQ2NzcsICJleHAiOjE2NjA0MDEwNzcgfQ.giBrf2UQjMRATBXZnJ-6B3dJQbeoVjfjlVhsjCtbjJBYBjJ8_qZW_s2YPZs3fWSpMWUVTX05Jsj1Xg4wnlQrGA
```
The token is printed and also written to `admin-jwt.txt`. We'll use this token in the next steps to access API Gateway securely. Note that the token is valid for a pre-defined period (see `TTL` in the script).

### Setup defaults using a Gadget snap
Setting up default options for snaps is possible with the gadget snap. 
We will go back to the same `gadget.yml` file for the gadget that we used to resize the volumes, but this time also add a new top level `defaults` key:

Add the following to `gadget.yml`.
Replace the public key with the content of your public key in `public.pem`:
```yml
# Add default config options
# The keys are unique snap IDs
defaults:
  AZGf0KNnh8aqdkbGATNuRuxnt1GNRKkV: # edgexfoundry
    # Enable app options
    app-options: true
    # Set the admin user's public key
    apps.secrets-config.proxy.admin.public-key: |
      -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
      MFkwEwYHKoZIzj0CAQYIKoZIzj0DAQcDQgAE5slZTyp5Zfxoos7TljHgPSbGm3As
      NZGr6EEet300xbC4VUVGcQBSEsSZmGMTxaCMlzvKt1dwUNxBFDAemWXSyg==
      -----END PUBLIC KEY-----

  AmKuVTOfsN0uEKsyJG34M8CaMfnIqxc0: # edgex-device-virtual
    # automatically start the service
    autostart: true
    # Enable app options
    app-options: true # not necessary because this service has it by default
    # Override the startup message (because we can)
    # The same syntax can be used to override most of the server configurations
    apps.device-virtual.config.service-startupmsg: "Startup message from gadget!"
```

!!! tip "Snap ID"
    Query the unique store ID of a snap, for example the `edgexfoundry` snap:
    ```
    $ snap info edgexfoundry | grep snap-id
    snap-id: AZGf0KNnh8aqdkbGATNuRuxnt1GNRKkV
    ```

The public key is taken from `public.pem` generated in the previous section.

Refer to the following for details:

- [Managing services](../../getting-started/Ch-GettingStartedSnapUsers/#managing-services)
- [Adding API Gateway Users](../../getting-started/Ch-GettingStartedSnapUsers/#adding-api-gateway-users)


Build:
```bash title="ðŸ–¥ Desktop"
$ snapcraft
...
Snapped pc_20-0.4_amd64.snap
```

!!! note
    You need to rebuild the snap every time you change the gadget.yaml file.

### Build the image
Use ubuntu-image tool again to build a new image. Use the same instructions as [before](#build-the-ubuntu-core-image) to build:

```bash title="ðŸ–¥ Desktop"
ubuntu-image snap model.signed.yaml --validation=enforce --snap pc-amd64-gadget/pc_20-0.4_amd64.snap
```

!!! done
    The image file is now ready to be flashed on a medium to create a bootable drive with the needed applications and basic configurations.

### TRY IT OUT
Refer to the following to:

- [Run in an emulator](#run-in-an-emulator) - used in this guide
- [Flash the image on disk](#flash-the-image-on-disk)

This time, as set in the gadget defaults, Device Virtual is started by default and we have a user to securely interact with the API Gateway.

!!! info
    SSH to the machine and verify that Device Virtual is enabled (to start on boot) and active (running):
    ``` title="ðŸš€ Ubuntu Core"
    $ snap services edgex-device-virtual
    Service                              Startup  Current  Notes
    edgex-device-virtual.device-virtual  enabled  active   -
    ```

    Verify that the public key is there as a snap option:
    ``` title="ðŸš€ Ubuntu Core"
    $ snap get edgexfoundry apps.secrets-config -d
    {
      "apps.secrets-config": {
        "proxy": {
          "admin": {
            "public-key": "-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----\nMFkwEwYHKoZIzj0CAQYIKoZIzj0DAQcDQgAE5slZTyp5Zfxoos7TljHgPSbGm3As\nNZGr6EEet300xbC4VUVGcQBSEsSZmGMTxaCMlzvKt1dwUNxBFDAemWXSyg==\n-----END PUBLIC KEY-----\n"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    Verify that Device Virtual has the startup message set from the gadget:
    ``` title="ðŸš€ Ubuntu Core"
    $ snap logs -n=all edgex-device-virtual | grep "Startup message"
    2022-08-19T13:51:28Z edgex-device-virtual.device-virtual[4660]: level=INFO ts=2022-08-19T13:51:28.868688382Z app=device-virtual source=variables.go:352 msg="Variables override of 'Service.StartupMsg' by environment variable: SERVICE_STARTUPMSG=Startup message from gadget!"
    ```

To query data securely from another host, we need to query the API Gateway. Let's query API Gateway from outside of the machine. The hostname is still `localhost` because this guide runs the image in an emulator on the same machine.
```bash title="ðŸ–¥ Desktop"
curl --insecure --silent --show-err https://localhost:8443/core-data/api/v2/reading/all?limit=2 -H "Authorization: Bearer $(cat admin-jwt.txt)" | jq
```

```json title="Response"
{
  "apiVersion": "v2",
  "statusCode": 200,
  "totalCount": 939,
  "readings": [
    {
      "id": "eb1faad8-d93d-4793-b2e7-19d0cf13c183",
      "origin": 1660314781398850300,
      "deviceName": "Random-Boolean-Device",
      "resourceName": "Bool",
      "profileName": "Random-Boolean-Device",
      "valueType": "Bool",
      "value": "true"
    },
    {
      "id": "2c1ea95a-b5b0-4051-a5b6-24d98f40a5c3",
      "origin": 1660314776365793500,
      "deviceName": "Random-Integer-Device",
      "resourceName": "Int64",
      "profileName": "Random-Integer-Device",
      "valueType": "Int64",
      "value": "-8755202057804760537"
    }
  ]
}
```

The response is similar to if query was sent directly to Core Data (http://localhost:59880/api/v2/reading/all?limit=2), except that it was done over TLS and with authentication. We didn't need to bind the Core Data's server to other interfaces or expose its port to outside.

!!! tip
    EdgeX's API Gateway internally generated a self-signed TLS certificate. The system doesn't trust that certificate and that's why we set the `--insecure` flag for cURL.

    Refer [here](../../getting-started/Ch-GettingStartedSnapUsers/#changing-tls-certificates) to learn how you can replace the certificate with one that your system trusts.

In this chapter, we created an OS image which comes with EdgeX components that are automatically started and configured to securely receive external requests. 
We can extend the server configurations by setting other defaults in the gadget.
This is sufficient in most scenarios and allows creating an image that is configured and ready for production.

The server configuration is made possible via a combination of snap options and environment variable overrides implemented for EdgeX services. There are two situations in which we need to override entire configuration files instead of fields one by one:

1. When we have to easily override many configuration fields: it is very cumbersome to override many configuration fields one by one.
2. When we need to add or change device, profile, and provision watcher configurations.

For the above cases, we need to supply whole configuration files to applications.
In the next chapter, we walk through creating a Snap package with our custom configuration files. The package will become part of the OS image and supply necessary configurations to all other EdgeX applications.

## C. Override configuration files

This chapter builds on top of what we did previously and shows how to override entire configuration files with a packaged copy, prepared for an specific use case.

### Create a config provider for Device Virtual
The EdgeX Device Virtual service cannot be fully configured using environment variables / snap options. Because of that, we need to package the modified config files and replace the defaults.
Moreover, it is tedious to override many configurations one by one, compared to having a file which contains all the needed modifications.

Since we want to create an OS image pre-loaded with the configured system, we need to make sure the configurations are there without any manual user interaction. We do that by creating a snap which provides the configuration files/directories to the Device Virtual snap:

- configuration.yaml
- devices/
- profiles/

For this exercise, we will modify the default configurations and remove most default devices and resources. We will also replace the startup message set in the `configuration.yaml` file.

This snap should be build and uploaded to the store. We use `edgex-config-provider-example` as the snap name. Refer to [docs](../../getting-started/Ch-GettingStartedSnapUsers/#config-provider-snap) for more details and example source code.

Build:
```bash title="ðŸ–¥ Desktop"
$ snapcraft
...
Snapped edgex-config-provider-example_2.3_amd64.snap
```

This will build for your host architecture, so if your machine is `amd64`, it will result in a snap that has the same architecture. You can perform [remote builds](https://snapcraft.io/docs/remote-build) to build for other architectures.

Let's upload the `amd64` snap and release it to the `latest/edge` channel:
```bash title="ðŸ–¥ Desktop"
snapcraft upload --release=latest/edge ./edgex-config-provider-example_2.3_amd64.snap
```

Now, we can query the snap ID from the store:
```bash title="ðŸ–¥ Desktop"
$ snap info edgex-config-provider-example | grep snap-id
snap-id: WWPGZGi1bImphPwrRfw46aP7YMyZYl6w
```
We need it in the next step.


### Add the config provider to the image

We have to make three adaptations:

1) Remove the Device Virtual config overrides from the gadget and re-build it

Commented out (or remove):
```yaml title="gadget.yaml"
    # # Enable app options
    # app-options: true # not necessary because this service has it by default
    # # Override the startup message (because we can)
    # # The same syntax can be used to override most of the server configurations
    # apps.device-virtual.config.service-startupmsg: "Startup message from gadget!"
```

!!! warning
    It is important to do this because overrides are ineffective when configurations are replaced from a config provider.
    This is because the config provider in our example is providing a read-only file system that doesn't allow the write access necessary to inject an environment file when setting the `app` options.

2) Connect the config provider 

```yaml title="gadget.yaml"
connections:
   -  # Connect edgex-device-virtual's plug (consumer)
      plug: AmKuVTOfsN0uEKsyJG34M8CaMfnIqxc0:device-virtual-config
      # to edgex-config-provider-example's slot (provider) to override the default configuration files.
      slot: WWPGZGi1bImphPwrRfw46aP7YMyZYl6w:device-virtual-config
```
This internally bind-mounts provider's "res" directory on top of the consumer's "res" directory.


3) Rebuild the gadget
```bash title="ðŸ–¥ Desktop"
$ snapcraft
...
Snapped pc_20-0.4_amd64.snap
```

4) Add the config provider snap to the model assertion, **after** all other edgex snaps:

```yaml title="model.yaml"
# This snap contains our configuration files
- name: edgex-config-provider-example
  type: app
  default-channel: latest/edge
  id: WWPGZGi1bImphPwrRfw46aP7YMyZYl6w
```

5) Sign the model as before
```bash title="ðŸ–¥ Desktop"
yq eval model.yaml -o=json | snap sign -k edgex-demo > model.signed.yaml
```
### Build the image
Use ubuntu-image tool again to build a new image. Use the same instructions as [before](#build-the-ubuntu-core-image) to build:

```bash title="ðŸ–¥ Desktop"
ubuntu-image snap model.signed.yaml --validation=enforce --snap pc-amd64-gadget/pc_20-0.4_amd64.snap
```

Note the addition of our config provider in output:
```
...
Fetching edgex-config-provider-example
...
```

!!! done
    The image file is now ready to be flashed on a medium to create a bootable drive with the needed applications and custom configuration files.

### TRY IT OUT
Refer to the following to:

- [Run in an emulator](#run-in-an-emulator) - used in this guide
- [Flash the image on disk](#flash-the-image-on-disk)

!!! info
    SSH to the machine and verify the installations:
    
    List of snaps:
    ``` title="ðŸš€ Ubuntu Core"
    $ snap list
    Name                           Version          Rev    Tracking       Publisher   Notes

    ```
    Note that we now also have `edgex-config-provider-example` in the list.

    Verify that Device Virtual only has one profile, as configured in the config provider:
    ``` title="ðŸš€ Ubuntu Core"
    $ snap install edgex-cli
    edgex-cli 2.2.0 from Canonicalâœ“ installed
    $ edgex-cli device list
    Name                 Description                ServiceName     ProfileName          Labels                    AutoEvents
    Random-Float-Device  Example of Device Virtual  device-virtual  Random-Float-Device  [device-virtual-example]  [{30s false Float64}]
    ```

    Verify that Device Virtual has the startup message set from the provider:
    ``` title="ðŸš€ Ubuntu Core"
    $ snap logs -n=all edgex-device-virtual | grep "Startup message"
    2022-08-19T14:42:24Z edgex-device-virtual.device-virtual[5402]: level=INFO ts=2022-08-19T14:42:24.438798115Z app=device-virtual source=message.go:55 msg="Startup message from config provider"
    ```

Query the metadata of Device Virtual from your host machine. 
We have to use the same JWT created in chapter B.
```bash title="ðŸ–¥ Desktop"
curl --insecure --silent --show-err https://localhost:8443/core-data/api/v2/reading/all?limit=2 -H "Authorization: Bearer $(cat admin-jwt.txt)" | jq
```

}
```

## Run in an emulator
Running the image in an emulator makes it easier to quickly try the image and find out possible issues.

We use a `amd64` QEMU emulator. Refer to [Testing Ubuntu Core with QEMU](https://ubuntu.com/core/docs/testing-with-qemu) to setup the dependencies and learn about the various emulation options. Here, we provide the command to run without TPM emulation.

!!! warning
    The `pc.img` file passed to the emulator is used as the secondary storage. It persists any changes made to the partitions during the installation and any user modifications after the boot.
    You can stop and re-start the emulator at a later time without losing your changes.

    To do a fresh start or to flash this image on disk, your need to rebuild the image.
    Alternatively, you can make a copy before using it in QEMU.

Run the following command and wait for the boot to complete:
```bash title="ðŸ–¥ Desktop"
sudo qemu-system-x86_64 \
 -smp 4 \
 -m 4096 \
 -drive file=/usr/share/OVMF/OVMF_CODE.fd,if=pflash,format=raw,unit=0,readonly=on \
 -drive file=pc.img,cache=none,format=raw,id=disk1,if=none \
 -device virtio-blk-pci,drive=disk1,bootindex=1 \
 -machine accel=kvm \
 -serial mon:stdio \
 -net nic,model=virtio \
 -net user,hostfwd=tcp::8022-:22,hostfwd=tcp::8443-:8443,hostfwd=tcp::59880-:59880
```

The above command forwards:

- SSH port `22` of the emulator to `8022` on the host
- API Gateway's port `8433` for external and secure access to EdgeX endpoints
- Core Data's port `59880` for demonstration purposes in chapter A.

!!! failure "Could not set up host forwarding rule 'tcp::8443-:8443'"
    This means that the port 8443 is not available on the host. Try stopping the service that uses this port or change the host port (left hand side) to another port number, e.g. `tcp::18443-:8443`.
    
!!! success
    Once the installation is complete, you'll see the initialization interface; Refer [here](#initialization) for details.

## Flash the image on disk
!!! warning
    If you have used `pc.img` to install in QEMU, the image has changed. You need to rebuild a new copy before continuing.

The installation instructions are device specific. You may refer to Ubuntu Core section in [this page](https://ubuntu.com/download/iot). For example:

- [Intel NUC](https://ubuntu.com/download/intel-nuc) - applicable to most computers with an attached secondary storage
- [Raspberry Pi](https://ubuntu.com/download/raspberry-pi)

A precondition to continue with some of the instructions is to compress `pc.img`. This speeds up the transfer and makes the input file similar to official images, improving compatibility with the available instructions.

To compress with the lowest compression rate of zero:
```bash title="ðŸ–¥ Desktop"
$ xz -vk -0 pc.img
pc.img (1/1)
  100 %     817.2 MiB / 3,309.0 MiB = 0.247    10 MiB/s       5:30             

$ ls -lh pc.*
-rw-rw-r-- 1 ubuntu ubuntu 3.3G Sep 16 17:03 pc.img
-rw-rw-r-- 1 ubuntu ubuntu 818M Sep 16 17:03 pc.img.xz
```
A higher compression rate significantly increases the processing time and needed resources, with very little gain.

Follow the device specific instructions.

!!! success
    You may refer [here](#initialization) for the initialization steps appearing by default.

## Initialization
Once the installation is complete, you will see the interface of the `console-conf` program. It will walk you through the networking and user account setup. You'll need to enter the email address of your Ubuntu account to create a OS user account with your registered username and have your SSH public keys deployed as authorized SSH keys for that user.
If you haven't done so, follow the instructions [here](https://snapcraft.io/docs/creating-your-developer-account) to add your SSH keys before doing this setup.

Read [here](https://ubuntu.com/core/docs/system-user) to know how the manual account setup looks like and how it can be automated.
