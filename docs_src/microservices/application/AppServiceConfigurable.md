# App Service Configurable

## Getting Started 

App-Service-Configurable is provided as an easy way to get started with processing data flowing through EdgeX. This service leverages the [App Functions SDK](https://github.com/edgexfoundry/app-functions-sdk-go) and provides a way for developers to use configuration instead of having to compile standalone services to utilize built in functions in the SDK. Please refer to [Available Configurable Pipeline Functions](#available-configurable-pipeline-functions)  section below for full list of built-in functions that can be used in the configurable pipeline. 

To get started with App Service Configurable, you'll want to start by determining which functions are required in your pipeline. Using a simple example, let's assume you wish to use the following functions from the SDK:

1. [FilterByDeviceName](../BuiltIn/#by-device-name) -  to filter events for a specific device.
2. [Transform](../BuiltIn/#xml) - to transform the data to XML
3. [HTTPExport](../BuiltIn/#http-export) - to send the data to an HTTP endpoint that takes our XML data   

Once the functions have been identified, we'll go ahead and build out the configuration in the `configuration.yaml` file under the `[Writable.Pipeline]` section.

!!! example "Example - Writable.Pipeline"
    ```toml
    [Writable]
    LogLevel = "DEBUG"
      [Writable.Pipeline]
        ExecutionOrder = "FilterByDeviceName, Transform, HTTPExport"
        [Writable.Pipeline.Functions]
          [Writable.Pipeline.Functions.FilterByDeviceName]
            [Writable.Pipeline.Functions.FilterByDeviceName.Parameters]
            FilterValues = "Random-Float-Device, Random-Integer-Device"
          [Writable.Pipeline.Functions.Transform]
            [Writable.Pipeline.Functions.Transform.Parameters]
            Type = "xml"
          [Writable.Pipeline.Functions.HTTPExport]
            [Writable.Pipeline.Functions.HTTPExport.Parameters]
            Method = "post" 
            MimeType = "application/xml" 
            Url = "http://my.api.net/edgexdata"
    ```

The first line of note is `ExecutionOrder = "FilterByDeviceName, Transform, HTTPExport"`. This specifies the order in which to execute your functions. Each function specified here must also be placed in the `[Writeable.Pipeline.Functions]` section. 

Next, each function and its required information is listed. Each function typically has associated Parameters that must be configured to properly execute the function as designated by `[Writable.Pipeline.Functions.{FunctionName}.Parameters]`. Knowing which parameters are required for each function, can be referenced by taking a look at  the [Available Configurable Pipeline Functions](#available-configurable-pipeline-functions) section below.

!!! note
    By default, the configuration provided is set to use `EdgexMessageBus` as a trigger. This means you must have EdgeX Running with devices sending data in order to trigger the pipeline. You can also change the trigger to be HTTP. For more details on triggers, view the `Triggers`documentation located in the [Triggers](./Triggers.md) section.

That's it! Now we can run/deploy this service and the functions pipeline will process the data with functions we've defined.

## Pipeline Per Topics

!!! edgey "EdgeX 2.1"
    Pipeline Per Topics is new for EdgeX 2.1

The above pipeline configuration in [Getting Started](#getting-started) section is the preferred way if your use case only requires a single functions pipeline. For use cases that require multiple functions pipelines in order to process the data differently based on the `profile`, `device` or `source` for the Event, there is the Pipeline Per Topics feature. This feature allows multiple pipelines to be configured in the `[Writable.Pipeline.PerTopicPipelines]`section. This section is a map of pipelines. The map key must be unique , but isn't used so can be any value. Each pipleline is defined by the following configuration settings:

- Id - This is the unique ID given to each pipeline
- Topics - Comma separated list of topics that control when the pipeline is executed. See [Pipeline Per Topics](../AdvancedTopics/#pipeline-per-topics)  for details on using wildcards in the topic.
- ExecutionOrder - This is the list of functions, in order, that the pipeline will execute. Same as `ExecutionOrder` in the above example in the  [Getting Started](#getting-started) section

!!! example "Example - Writable.Pipeline.PerTopicPipelines"
    In this example Events from the device  `Random-Float-Device` are transformed to JSON and then HTTP exported. At the same time, Events for the source `Int8`  are transformed to XML and then HTTP exported to same endpoint. Note the custom naming for `TransformJson` and `TransformXml`. This is taking advantage of the [Multiple Instances of a Function](#multiple-instances-of-a-function) described below.

    ```toml
    [Writable]
    LogLevel = "DEBUG"
      [Writable.Pipeline]
        [Writable.Pipeline.PerTopicPipelines]
          [Writable.Pipeline.PerTopicPipelines.float]
          Id = "float-pipeline"
          Topics = "edgex/events/device/+/Random-Float-Device/#, edgex/events/device/+/Random-Integer-Device/#"
          ExecutionOrder = "TransformJson, HTTPExport"
          [Writable.Pipeline.PerTopicPipelines.int8]
          Id = "int8-pipeline"
          Topic = "edgex/events/device/+/+/Int8"
          ExecutionOrder = "TransformXml, HTTPExport"  
        [Writable.Pipeline.Functions]
          [Writable.Pipeline.Functions.FilterByDeviceName]
            [Writable.Pipeline.Functions.FilterByDeviceName.Parameters]
            FilterValues = "Random-Float-Device, Random-Integer-Device"
          [Writable.Pipeline.Functions.TransformJson]
            [Writable.Pipeline.Functions.TransformJson.Parameters]
            Type = "json"
          [Writable.Pipeline.Functions.TransformXml]
            [Writable.Pipeline.Functions.TransformXml.Parameters]
            Type = "xml"        
          [Writable.Pipeline.Functions.HTTPExport]
            [Writable.Pipeline.Functions.HTTPExport.Parameters]
            Method = "post" 
            MimeType = "application/xml" 
            Url = "http://my.api.net/edgexdata"
    ```

!!! note
    The `Pipeline Per Topics` feature is targeted for EdgeX MessageBus and External MQTT triggers, but can be used with Custom or HTTP triggers. When used with the HTTP trigger the incoming topic will always be `blank`, so the pipeline's topics must contain a single topic set to the `#` wildcard so that all messages received are processed by the pipeline.

## Environment Variable Overrides For Docker

EdgeX services no longer have docker specific profiles. They now rely on environment variable overrides in the docker compose files for the docker specific differences.

!!! example "Example - Environment settings required in the compose files for App Service Configurable "
    ```yaml
          EDGEX_PROFILE : [target profile]
          SERVICE_HOST : [services network host name]
          EDGEX_SECURITY_SECRET_STORE: "false" # only need to disable as default is true
          CLIENTS_CORE_COMMAND_HOST: edgex-core-command
          CLIENTS_CORE_DATA_HOST: edgex-core-data
          CLIENTS_CORE_METADATA_HOST: edgex-core-metadata
          CLIENTS_SUPPORT_NOTIFICATIONS_HOST: edgex-support-notifications
          CLIENTS_SUPPORT_SCHEDULER_HOST: edgex-support-scheduler
          DATABASE_HOST: edgex-redis
          MESSAGEQUEUE_HOST: edgex-redis
          REGISTRY_HOST: edgex-core-consul
          TRIGGER_EDGEXMESSAGEBUS_PUBLISHHOST_HOST: edgex-redis
          TRIGGER_EDGEXMESSAGEBUS_SUBSCRIBEHOST_HOST: edgex-redis
    ```

!!! example - "Example - Docker compose entry for **App Service Configurable** in no-secure compose file"
    ```yaml
      app-service-rules:
        container_name: edgex-app-rules-engine
        depends_on:
        - consul
        - data
        environment:
          CLIENTS_CORE_COMMAND_HOST: edgex-core-command
          CLIENTS_CORE_DATA_HOST: edgex-core-data
          CLIENTS_CORE_METADATA_HOST: edgex-core-metadata
          CLIENTS_SUPPORT_NOTIFICATIONS_HOST: edgex-support-notifications
          CLIENTS_SUPPORT_SCHEDULER_HOST: edgex-support-scheduler
          DATABASE_HOST: edgex-redis
          EDGEX_PROFILE: rules-engine
          EDGEX_SECURITY_SECRET_STORE: "false"
          MESSAGEQUEUE_HOST: edgex-redis
          REGISTRY_HOST: edgex-core-consul
          SERVICE_HOST: edgex-app-rules-engine
          TRIGGER_EDGEXMESSAGEBUS_PUBLISHHOST_HOST: edgex-redis
          TRIGGER_EDGEXMESSAGEBUS_SUBSCRIBEHOST_HOST: edgex-redis
        hostname: edgex-app-rules-engine
        image: edgexfoundry/app-service-configurable:2.0.0
        networks:
          edgex-network: {}
        ports:
        - 127.0.0.1:59701:59701/tcp
        read_only: true
        security_opt:
        - no-new-privileges:true
        user: 2002:2001
    ```

!!! note
    **App Service Configurable** is designed to be run multiple times each with different profiles. This is why in the above example the name `edgex-app-rules-engine` is used for the instance running the `rules-engine` profile.

## Deploying Multiple Instances using profiles

App Service Configurable was designed to be deployed as multiple instances for different purposes. Since the function pipeline is specified in the `configuration.yaml` file, we can use this as a way to run each instance with a different function pipeline. App Service Configurable does not have the standard default configuration at `/res/configuration.yaml`. This default configuration has been moved to the `sample` profile. This forces you to specify the profile for the configuration you would like to run. The profile is specified using the `-p/--profile=[profilename]` command line option or the `EDGEX_PROFILE=[profilename]` environment variable override. The profile name selected is used in the service key (`app-[profile name]`) to make each instance unique, e.g. `AppService-sample` when specifying `sample` as the profile.

!!! edgey "Edgex 2.0"
    Default service key for App Service Configurable instances has changed in Edgex 2.0 from `AppService-[profile name]` to `app-[profile name]`

!!! note
    If you need to run multiple instances with the same profile, e.g. `http-export`, but configured differently, you will need to override the service key with a custom name for one or more of the services. This is done with the `-sk/-serviceKey` command-line option or the `EDGEX_SERVICE_KEY` environment variable. See the [Command-line Options](./ApplicationFunctionsSDK.md#command-line-options) and [Environment Overrides](./ApplicationFunctionsSDK.md#environment-variable-overrides) sections for more detail.

!!! note
    Functions can be declared in a profile but not used in the pipeline `ExecutionOrder`  allowing them to be added to the pipeline `ExecutionOrder` later at runtime if needed.

The following profiles and their purposes are provided with App Service Configurable. 

### rules-engine

Profile used to push Event messages to the Rules Engine via the **Redis Pub/Sub** Message Bus. This is used in the default docker compose files for the `app-rules-engine` service

## What if my input data isn't an EdgeX Event ?

The default `TargetType` for data flowing into the functions pipeline is an EdgeX Event DTO. There are cases when this incoming data might not be an EdgeX Event DTO. There are two setting that configure the TargetType to non-Event data.

### Raw TargetType

 In these cases the `Pipeline` can be configured using `TargetType="raw"` to set the `TargetType` to be a byte array/slice, i.e. `[]byte`. The first function in the pipeline must then be one that can handle the `[]byte` data. The **compression**,  **encryption** and **export** functions are examples of pipeline functions that will take input data that is `[]byte`. 

!!! example "Example - Configure the functions pipeline to **compress**, **encrypt** and then **export** the `[]byte` data via HTTP "
    ```toml
    [Writable]
      LogLevel = "DEBUG"
      [Writable.Pipeline]
        TargetType = "raw"
        ExecutionOrder = "Compress, Encrypt, HTTPExport"
        [Writable.Pipeline.Functions.Compress]
          [Writable.Pipeline.Functions.Compress.Parameters]
          Alogrithm = "gzip"
        [Writable.Pipeline.Functions.Encrypt]
          [Writable.Pipeline.Functions.Encrypt.Parameters]
            Algorithm = "aes"
            Key = "aquqweoruqwpeoruqwpoeruqwpoierupqoweiurpoqwiuerpqowieurqpowieurpoqiweuroipwqure"
            InitVector = "123456789012345678901234567890"
        [Writable.Pipeline.Functions.HTTPExport]
          [Writable.Pipeline.Functions.HTTPExport.Parameters]
          Method = "post"
          Url = "http://my.api.net/edgexdata"
          MimeType = "application/text"
    ```

If along with this pipeline configuration, you also configured the `Trigger` to be `http` trigger,  you could then send any data to the app-service-configurable' s `/api/v2/trigger` endpoint and have it compressed, encrypted and sent to your configured URL above.

!!! example "Example - HTTP Trigger configuration"
    ``` toml
    [Trigger]
    Type="http"
    ```

### Metric TargetType

This setting when set to true will cause the `TargeType` to be `&dtos.Metric{}` and is meant to be used in conjunction with the new `ToLineProtocol` function. See [ToLineProtocol](#tolineprotocol) section below for more details. In addition the `Trigger` `SubscribeTopics`must be set to `"edgex/telemetry/#"` so that the function receives the metric data from the other services.

!!! example - "Example -  Metric TargetType "
    ```
      [Writable.Pipeline]
      TargetType  = "metric"
      ExecutionOrder = "ToLineProtocol, ..."
      ...
          [Writable.Pipeline.Functions.ToLineProtocol]
          [Writable.Pipeline.Functions.ToLineProtocol.Parameters]
          Tags = "" # optional comma separated list of additional tags to add to the metric in to form "tag:value,..."
      ...
      [Trigger]
      Type="edgex-messagebus"
      [Trigger.EdgexMessageBus]
      ...
        [Trigger.EdgexMessageBus.SubscribeHost]
        ...
        SubscribeTopics="edgex/telemetry/#"
    ```

## Multiple Instances of a Function

!!! edgey "Edgex 2.0"
    New for EdgeX 2.0

Now multiple instances of the same configurable pipeline function can be specified,  configured differently and used together in the functions pipeline. Previously the function names specified in the `[Writable.Pipeline.Functions]` section had to match a built-in configurable pipeline function name exactly. Now the names specified only need to start with a built-in configurable pipeline function name. See the [HttpExport](#httpexport) section below for an example.

## Available Configurable Pipeline Functions

Below are the functions that are available to use in the configurable pipeline function pipeline (`[Writable.Pipeline]`) section of the configuration. The function names below can be added to the `Writable.Pipeline.ExecutionOrder` setting (comma separated list) and must also be present or added to the `[Writable.Pipeline.Functions]` section as `[Writable.Pipeline.Functions.{FunctionName}]`. The functions will also have the `[Writable.Pipeline.Functions.{FunctionName}.Parameters]` section where the function's parameters are configured. Please refer to the [Getting Started](#getting-started) section above for an example.

!!! note
    The `Parameters` section for each function is a key/value map of `string` values. So even tough the parameter is referred to as an Integer or Boolean, it has to be specified as a valid string representation, e.g. "20" or "true".

Please refer to the function's detailed documentation by clicking the function name below.

### [AddTags](../BuiltIn/#tags)

**Parameters**

- `tags` - String containing comma separated list of tag key/value pairs. The tag key/value pairs are colon seperated
